Hi there, thank you for checking out my resume. 

(As seen on https://lucidkodo-resume.herokuapp.com/)

I am very aware that the nav bar is buggy, but only on iOS devices! 

If you have the solution for this, please do enlighten me. 

Have a beautiful day ahead, you mouse clicking, keyboard smashing human! :)
